[[_profiles]]

== Profiles

ifeval::[{project_community}==true]
{project_name} has a single profile, community, that enables all features by default, including features that
are considered less mature. It is however possible to disable individual features.
endif::[]

ifeval::[{project_product}==true]
{project_name} has two profiles, product and preview. The product profile is enabled by default, which disables
some tech preview features. To enable the features you can either switch to the preview profile or enable individual
features.

To enable the preview profile start the server with:

[source]
----
bin/standalone.sh|bat -Dkeycloak.profile=preview
----

You can set this permanently by creating the file `standalone/configuration/profile.properties`
(or `domain/servers/server-one/configuration/profile.properties` for `server-one` in domain mode). Add the following to
the file:

[source]
----
profile=preview
----
endif::[]

The features that can be enabled and disabled are:

* Authorization - authorization services
* Docker - authentication protocol for Docker Registry
* Impersonation - ability for admins to impersonate users
* Script - write custom authenticators using JavaScript

ifeval::[{project_product}==true]
The product profile disables authorization and script.
endif::[]

To disable a specific feature start the server with:

[source]
----
bin/standalone.sh|bat -Dkeycloak.profile.feature.<feature name>=disabled
----

For example to disable Impersonation use `-Dkeycloak.profile.feature.impersonation=disabled`.

You can set this permanently in the `profile.properties` file by adding:

[source]
----
feature.impersonation=disabled
----

ifeval::[{project_product}==true]
To enable a specific feature without enabling the full preview profile you can start the server with:

[source]
----
bin/standalone.sh|bat -Dkeycloak.profile.feature.<feature name>=enabled`
----

For example to enable Authorization Services use `-Dkeycloak.profile.feature.authorization=enabled`.

You can set this permanently in the `profile.properties` file by adding:

[source]
----
feature.authorization=enabled
----
endif::[]
