==== Entitlement Request Metadata

When requesting entitlements client applications are allowed to associate metadata information to the request and define how
they expect to obtain the permissions.

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer ${access_token}" -d '{
    "metadata" : {
        "include_resource_name" : false
    },
    "permissions" : [
        ...
    ]
}' "http://${host}:${port}/auth/realms/${realm_name}/authz/entitlement/{client_id}"
```

[NOTE]
The Entitlement API endpoint only allows passing metadata along an entitlement request when using HTTP POST.

The following sections will explain how and when you can use the different information you can include in an entitlement request as a metadata.

==== Decide whether or not resource's name should be included the response

.include_resource_name
```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer ${access_token}" -d '{
    "metadata" : {
        "include_resource_name" : false
    },
    "permissions" : [
        ...
    ]
}' "http://${host}:${port}/auth/realms/${realm_name}/authz/entitlement/{client_id}"
```
Clients can use ```include_resource_name``` to decide whether or not resource`s name should be included on each permission granted by the server. This option
can be used to reduce the size of RPTs and optimize client-server communication.

By default, permissions in a RPT contain both the id and name of the resource that was granted for every single permission. This option is specially useful
when the resource server is capable of map their resources only based on the resource`s id.
