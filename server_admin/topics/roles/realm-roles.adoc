=== Realm Roles

Realm level roles are a global namespace to define your roles.  You can see the list of built-in and created roles
by clicking on the `Roles` left menu item.

To create a role just click on the `Add Role` button on this page, enter in the name and description of the role
and hit the `Save` button.

The value for the `description` field is localizable by specifying a substitution variable with `$\{var-name}` strings.
The localized value is then configured within property files in your theme.  See the link:{{book.project.doc_base_url}}{{book.project.doc_info_version_url}}{{book.developerguide.link}}[{{book.developerguide.name}}]
for more information on localization.  If a client requires user _consent_, this description string will be displayed on the
consent page for the user.

If the client has to explicitly request for a realm role, set `Scope Param Required` to true. The role then has to be specified via the `scope` parameter when requesting a token. Multiple realm roles are separated by space:

`scope=admin user`
