=== Client Roles

Client roles are basically a namespace dedicated to a client.  Each client gets its own namespace.  Client roles are managed
under the `Roles` tab under each individual client.  You interact with this UI the same way you do for realm level roles.

If the client has to explicitly request for another client's role, the role has to prefixed with the client's id when requesting via the scope parameter. For example, if the client id is `account` and the role is `admin`, the scope parameter should be:
 
 `scope=account/admin`
 
 As noted in the realm roles section, multiple roles are separated by spaces.
