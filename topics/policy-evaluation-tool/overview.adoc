== Policy Evaluation Tool

When designing your policies, you can use an UI to simulate authorization requests and check how your policies are being evaluated.

The *Policy Evaluation Tool* can be accessed by clicking the *Evaluate* tab when editing a resource server. There you may provide different inputs to simulate real authorization requests and check the effect of your policies.
