== Creating a Realm and a User

The first step is to create a realm and a user in that realm. The realm consists of:

* A single user

* A single client application, which then becomes a link:../../overview/terminology.html[resource server] for which you need to enable authorization services.

To create a realm and a user complete the following steps:

1. Create a realm with a name *hello-world-authz*. Once created, a page similar to the following is displayed:

.Realm hello-world-authz

2. Create a user for your newly created realm. Click *Users*. The user list page opens. 

3. On the right side of the empty user list, click *Add User*. 

4. Complete the fields as shown in the screenshot below to create a new user with the username of *alice* and then click *Save*.

6. Complete the *New Password* and *Password Confirmation* fields with a password and click the *Temporary* switch to *OFF*. 

7. Click *Reset Password* to set the user's password.
