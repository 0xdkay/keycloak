== Enabling Authorization Services

You can enable authorization services in an existing client application configured to use the OpenID Connect Protocol. You can also create a new client.

To create a new client, complete the following steps:

1. Click *Clients* to start creating a new client application and fill in the fields as shown in the screenshot below:

2. Click *Save*. The Client Details page is displayed.

3. On the Client Details page, click the *Authorization Enabled* switch to *ON*, and then click *Save*.
A new *Authorization* tab is displayed for the client. 

4. Click the *Authorization* tab and an Authorization Settings page similar to the following is displayed:

.Authorization Settings

When you enable authorization services for a client application, {{book.project.name}} automatically creates several link:../../resource-server/default-config.html[default settings] for your client authorization configuration.

For more information about authorization configuration, see link:../../resource-server/enable-authorization.html[Enabling Authorization Services].
