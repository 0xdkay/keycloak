== Getting Started

All tutorials are based on the *{{book.project.name}} Demo Distribution*.

* *keycloak-demo-{{book.project.version}}.[zip|tar.gz]*

To unpack this file run the _unzip_ or _gunzip_ and _tar_ utilities. Throughout this guide the directory where you have unpacked
the demo distribution is referenced as *${KEYCLOAK_DEMO_SERVER_DIR}*.

[NOTE]
This guide assumes that you are already familiar with {{book.project.name}} and that you are able to install and boot a {{book.project.name}} Server. For more information, see the link:{{book.project.doc-base-url}}{{book.project.doc-info-version-url}}{{book.external_link.keycloakgettingstarted.link}}[{{book.external_link.keycloakgettingstarted.name}}] tutorials.

Ensure you have a {{book.project.name}} instance running; the default configuration is http://localhost:8080/auth[http://localhost:8080/auth]. After logging in to the
Administration Console, a page similar to this one is displayed:

.{{book.project.name}} Administration Console

All source code for the getting started tutorials can be obtained from the demo distributions. The authorization-related examples
are located at *${KEYCLOAK_DEMO_SERVER_DIR}/examples/authz*.
