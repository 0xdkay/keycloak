== Bearer Token Enforcement Filter

The *org.keycloak.authorization.policy.enforcer.servlet.BearerTokenEnforcementFilter* can be used to protect servlet applications providing
RESTful services. For instance, applications using JAX-RS.

This filter does not require that your application is configured with any {{book.project.name}} OIDC Adapter.

To configure it, change your web application descriptor (WEB-INF/web.xml) as follows:

```xml
<filter>
    <filter-name>Keycloak Authorization Enforcer</filter-name>
    <filter-class>org.keycloak.authorization.policy.enforcer.servlet.BearerTokenEnforcementFilter</filter-class>
</filter>

<filter-mapping>
    <filter-name>Keycloak Authorization Enforcer</filter-name>
    <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
</filter-mapping>
```

=== Configuration

The BearerTokenEnforcementFilter can be configured by a simple JSON file. The file can be as simple as:

```json
{
  "client": {
    "configurationUrl": "http://localhost:8080/auth/realms/{realm_name}/authz/uma_configuration",
    "clientId": "{client_id}",
    "clientSecret": "{client_secret}"
  },
  "enforcer": {}
}
```
Or a little more verbose if you want to manually define the resources being protected:

```json
{
  "client": {
    "configurationUrl": "http://localhost:8080/auth/realms/{realm_name}/authz/uma_configuration",
    "clientId": "{client_id}",
    "clientSecret": "{client_secret}"
  },
  "enforcer": {
    "paths": [
      {
        "path" : "/someUri/*",
        "methods" : [
          {
            "method": "GET",
            "scopes" : ["urn:app.com:scopes:view"]
          },
          {
            "method": "POST",
            "scopes" : ["urn:app.com:scopes:create"]
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "name" : "Some Resource",
        "path" : "/usingPattern/{id}",
        "methods" : [
          {
            "method": "DELETE",
            "scopes" : ["urn:app.com:scopes:delete"]
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "path" : "/exactMatch"
      },
      {
        "name" : "Admin Resources",
        "path" : "/usingWildCards/*"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The file with the enforcer configuration must be under your application's classpath as *keycloak-authz.json".

Here is a description of each configuration option:

* *client*
+
Specify the information about the resource server being protected
+
** *configurationUrl*
+
A URL pointing to a configuration endpoint. This is important for the automatic discovery of the services invoked during the authorization process.
+
** *clientId*
+
The id of the client acting as a resource server.
+
** *clientSecret*
+
The client secret.
+
* *enforcer*
+
Specify the configuration options to define how policies are actually enforced and optionally the paths you want to protect. If empty, the policy enforcer will query the server
for all resources associated with the resource server being protected. In this case, you need to make sure the resources are properly configured with a *uri* property that matches the paths
 you want to protect.
+
** *paths*
+
Specify the paths to protect.
+
*** *name*
+
The name of a resource in the server that must be associated with a given path. If provided, the policy enforcer will ignore the resource's *uri* property and use the path you provided.
*** *path*
+
A URI relative to the application's context path. If this option is provided, the policy enforcer will query the server for a resource with a *uri* with the same value.
Right now, we support some very basic logic for path matching. Examples of valid paths are:
+
**** Wildcards: `/*`
**** Suffix: `/*.html`
**** Sub-paths: `/path/*`
**** Path parameters: /resource/{id}
**** Exact match: /resource
+
*** *methods*
The HTTP methods to protect and how they are associated with the scopes for a given resource in the server.
+
**** *method*
+
The name of the HTTP method.
+
**** *scopes*
+
An array of strings with the scopes associated with the method.

=== Container Specific Configuration

==== WildFly 10.0.0.Final

In order to make the filter available to your application at runtime, you must create a *META-INF/jboss-deployment-structure.xml* at the application root directory.

```xml
<jboss-deployment-structure>
    <deployment>
        <dependencies>
            <module name="org.keycloak.keycloak-authz-servlet-enforcer" services="import"/>
            <module name="org.jboss.resteasy.resteasy-jackson2-provider" services="import"/>
        </dependencies>
        <exclusions>
            <module name="org.jboss.resteasy.resteasy-jackson-provider"/>
        </exclusions>
    </deployment>
</jboss-deployment-structure>
