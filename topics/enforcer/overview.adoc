== Policy Enforcers

PEP is a design pattern and as such you can implement it in different ways. {{book.project.name}} provides all the necessary means
to implement PEPs for different platforms, environments and using different programming languages. After all, {{book.project.name}} {{book.project.module}} is
fully RESTFUL-based, leveraging OAuth2 authorization capabilities to also support fine-grained authorization using a centralized authorization server.
