== OpenID Connect

Keycloak can secure a wide variety of application types.
This section defines which application types are supported and how to configure and install them so that you can use Keycloak to secure your applications.

These client adapters use an extension of the OpenID Connect protocol (a derivate of OAuth 2.0). This extension provides support for clustering, backchannel logout, and other non-standard adminstrative functions.
The Keycloak project also provides a separate, standalone, generic, SAML client adapter.
But that is describe in a separate document and has a different download.
