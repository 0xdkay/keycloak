=== Mapping/Importing SAML and OIDC Metadata

You can import SAML assertion data, OpenID Connect ID Token claims, and Keycloak access token claims into new users that are imported from a brokered IDP.
After you configure a broker, you'll see a `Mappers`            button appear.
Click on that and you'll get to the list of mappers that are assigned to this broker.
There is a `Create` button on this page.
Clicking on this create button allows you to create a broker mapper.
Broker mappers can import SAML attributes or OIDC ID/Access token claims into user attributes.
You can assign a role mapping to a user if a claim or external role exists.
There's a bunch of options here so just mouse over the tool tips to see what each mapper can do for you.

=== Mapping/Importing User profile data from Social Identity Provider

You can import user profile data provided by social identity providers like Google, GitHub, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Stackoverflow and Facebook  into new Keycloak user created from given social accounts.
After you configure a broker, you'll see a `Mappers`            button appear.
Click on that and you'll get to the list of mappers that are assigned to this broker.
There is a `Create` button on this page.
Clicking on this create button allows you to create a broker mapper.
"Attribute Importer" mapper allows you to define path in JSON user profile data provided by the provider to get value from.
You can use dot notation for nesting and square brackets to access fields in array by index.
For example 'contact.address[0].country'.  Then you can define name of Keycloak's user profile attribute this value is stored into.

To investigate structure of user profile JSON data provided by social providers you can enable `DEBUG` level for  logger `org.keycloak.social.user_profile_dump` and login using given provider.
Then you can find user profile  JSON structure in Keycloak log file.
