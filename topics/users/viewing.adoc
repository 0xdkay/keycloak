=== Searching For Users

If you need to manage a specific user, click on `Users` in the left menu bar.

.Users

This menu option brings you to the user list page.  In the search box you can type in a full name, last name, or email address
you want to search for in the user database.  The query will bring up all users that match your criteria.  The `View all users` button
will list every user in the system.  This can be a dangerous operation if you have tens of thousands of users stored.  Some backends
like LDAP don't have a way to page through users and must return the whole user set!  So be careful before you execute a view all search.
