=== Disabling Caching

To disable the realm or user cache, you must edit the `keycloak-server.json` file in your distribution.  Where
this file lives depends on your <<fake/../../operating-mode.adoc#_operating-mode, operating mode>>
Here's what the config looks like initially.


[source,json]
----

    "userCache": {
        "default" : {
            "enabled": true
        }
    },

    "realmCache": {
        "default" : {
            "enabled": true
        }
    },
----

To disable the cache set the `enabled` field to false for the cache you want to disable.  You must reboot your
server for this change to take effect.
