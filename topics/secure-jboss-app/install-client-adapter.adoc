=== Install the Client Adapter

Download the JBoss EAP 7 or Wildfly 10 distribution you are going to use to run your example application and unzip
it into a directory on your machine.  Next download the {{book.clientadapter}} distribution.  Unzip
this file into the root directory of your JBoss EAP or Wildfly 10 distribution.  Next perform the following actions

server distribution.  Finally, just boot the application server.
