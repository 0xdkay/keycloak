=== Download, Build, Deploy Application Code

The project and code for the application you are going to secure is at Github.com.  You will need the following
installed on your machine and available in your PATH before you can continue:

* Java JDK 8
* Apache Maven 3.1.1 or higher

You can obtain the code by cloning the
quickstart repo at git@github.com:jboss-developer/rh-sso-quickstarts.git.  Follow these steps to download the code, build it,
and deploy it.  Make sure your JBoss EAP or Wildfly app server instance is running before you start these steps!

.Clone Project
[source]
----
$ git clone git@github.com:jboss-developer/rh-sso-quickstarts.git
$ cd rh-sso-quickstarts/app-profile-jee-vanilla
$ mvn clean wildfly:deploy
----

You should see some text scroll down in the app server console window.  After the app is successfully deployed go to:

http://localhost:8080/vanilla

.App Login Page

If you open up the application's _web.xml_ file you would see that the application is secured via `BASIC` authentication.
If you click on the login button on the login page, the browser
will pop up a BASIC auth login dialog.

The app is not secured by any identity provider, so anything you enter in the dialog box will result in a `Forbidden` message being
sent back by the server.  The next section describes how you can take this deployed app and secure it.
