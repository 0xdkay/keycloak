== Choosing a Deployment Mode

Before deploying {{book.project.name}} in a production environment you need to decide which type of deployment method
you are going to use.  Will you run {{book.project.name}} within a cluster?  Do you want a centralized way to manage
your server configurations?  This is where deciding the deployment mode comes in.  This decision
 effects how you configure databases, configure caching and even how you boot the server.

TIP: The {{book.project.name}} is built on top of the {{book.appserver.name}} Application Server.  This guide will only
     go over the basics for deployment within a specific mode.  If you want specific information on this, a better place
