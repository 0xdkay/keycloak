== Import/Export Authorization Configuration

Keycloak also allows you to import a JSON file with all the configuration for a resource server, as well export and download a JSON file with all the configuration
of an existing resource server.

When you import or export the configuration for a given resource server, you are doing it for all authorization configuration associated with it: resources, scopes, permissions,
policies, etc.
