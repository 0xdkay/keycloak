== Managing Resource Servers

If you are familiar with OAuth2, a Resource Server is the server hosting the protected resources and capable of accepting and responding to protected resource requests.

Resource servers usually rely on some kind of information to decide whether access to a protected resource should be granted or not. For RESTful-based resource servers,
that information is usually obtained from a security token, usually sent as a bearer token on every single request to the server. For web applications that rely on a session to
authenticate their users, that information is usually stored into user's session and retrieved from there on every single request.

You can see the list of resource servers by clicking on the `Authorization` left menu item.

To create a new resource server just click on the `Create` button.

Resource servers can be created manually or automatically based on the configuration within a JSON file.

When manually creating resource servers, the only required field is `Client`. This field allows you to choose an *existing* client applications that can be enabled as a resource server. In order to
make a client application available to this field, you need to make sure the client application is configured as follows:

* It must be a *confidential* client
* It must have a *Service Account*

[NOTE]
For more information about how to configure confidential clients and service accounts, please take a look at https://keycloak.gitbooks.io/server-adminstration-guide/[Server Administration Guide].

However, if you want to import an existing resource server configuration, you can click on the `Import JSON File` button and upload a JSON file holding the resource server configuration.

In any case, once you fill in the required fields you can click the `Save` button to create the resource server. This will bring you to the `Resource Server Settings` page.

Letâ€™s walk through each configuration item on this page.

* *Policy Enforcement Mode*
+
Dictates how policies are enforced when processing authorization requests sent to the server.
+
** *Enforcing*
+
This is the default mode. Requests are denied by default even when there is no policy associated with a given resource.
+
** *Permissive*
+
Requests are allowed even when there is no policy associated with a given resource.
** *Disabled*
+
Completely disables the evaluation of policies and allow access to any resource.
+
* *Allow Remote Resource Management*
+
Should resources be managed remotely by the resource server? If false, resources can only be managed from this admin console.

+
* *Export Settings*
+
In this section you can export all settings to a JSON file. It provides a single `Export` button that you can click to
download a JSON file containing every single configuration defined for a resource server: protected resources, scopes, permissions and policies.
