== Configuring Entitlements

Entitlements are very useful when you want to obtain all permissions for a specific user based on the resources managed by a resource server.
More on _Entitlements_ and _Incremental Authorization_ later.

When configuring a resource server you may enable/disable entitlements by clicking the *Entitlements* switch.
