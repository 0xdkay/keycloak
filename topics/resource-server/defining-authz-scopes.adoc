== Defining the uma_protection scope

In order to integrate with the server, you need to grant the role link:../service/protection-api.html[uma_protection] to the client application that you enabled as a
resource server.

When using the UMA protocol, this scope is also important to allow the resource server to ask the server for permission tickets.
