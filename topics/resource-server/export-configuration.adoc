== Exporting Resource Server Configuration

After creating a resource server, you can export all its configuration to a JSON file. For that, on the *Resource Server Details* page
click on *Export* button under *Export Settings*.

Once exported, you can use the configuration file to recreate your resource server or even share it with others in your team.
