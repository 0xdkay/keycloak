= Installing Distribution Files

The Keycloak Server is contained in one distribution file:

* +RH-SSO-{{book.project.version}}.[zip|tar.gz]+

The +RH-SSO-{{book.project.version}}.[zip|tar.gz]+ file is the server only distribution.  It contains nothing other than the scripts and binaries
to run the Keycloak Server.

To unpack of these files run the +unzip+ or +gunzip+ and +tar+ utilities.
