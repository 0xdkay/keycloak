= System Requirements

These are the requirements to run the {{book.project.name}} authentication server:

* Can run on any operating system that runs Java
* Java 8 JDK
* zip or gzip and tar
* Network multicast support if you are clustering {{book.project.name}}.
* At least 512M of RAM
* At least 1G of diskspace

{{book.project.name}} can be clustered without multicast, but this requires a bunch of configuration changes.  Please see
the <<fake/../clustering.adoc#,clustering>> section of this guide for more information.
