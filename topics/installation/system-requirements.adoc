=== System Requirements

These are the requirements to run the {{book.project.name}} authentication server:

* Can run on any operating system that runs Java
* Java 8 JDK
* zip or gzip and tar
* At least 512M of RAM
* At least 1G of diskspace
* A shared external database like Postgres, MySql, Oracle, etc.  {{book.project.name}} requires an external shared
  database if you want to run in a cluster.   Please see the <<fake/../../database.adoc#_database,database configuration>> section of this guide for more information.
* Network multicast support on your machine if you want to run in a cluster.  {{book.project.name}} can
 be clustered without multicast, but this requires a bunch of configuration changes.  Please see
 the <<fake/../../clustering.adoc#_clustering,clustering>> section of this guide for more information.
