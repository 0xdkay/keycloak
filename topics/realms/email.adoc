=== Email Settings

{{book.project.name}} will sometimes need to send out emails for example, when a user forgets their password, or when an admin
needs to receive a notification about a server event.  This is configured per realm.  Go to the `Realm Settings` left menu
item and click the `Email` tab.

The email settings should be self explanatory.  Consult your sys admin on the settings you need to connect to your email
server.
