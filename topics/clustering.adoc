== Clustering

This section covers configuring {{book.project.name}} to run in a cluster.  There's a number
of things you have to do when setting up a cluster, specifically:

* <<fake/../operating-mode.adoc#_operating-mode,Pick an operation mode>>
* <<fake/../database.adoc#_database,Configure a shared external database>>
* Set up a load balancer
* Supplying a private network that supports IP multicast

Picking an operation mode and configuring a shared database have been discussed earlier in this guide.  In this chapter
we'll discuss setting up a load balancer and supplying a private network.  We'll also discuss some issues that you need
to be aware of when booting up a host in the cluster.

NOTE:  It is possible to cluster {{book.project.name}} without IP Multicast, but this topic is beyond the scope of this guide.  For more information, see link:{{book.appserver.jgroups.link}}[JGroups] chapter of the _{{book.appserver.jgroups.name}}_.
