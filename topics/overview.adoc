== Guide Overview

The purpose of this guide is to walk through the steps that need to be completed prior to booting up the
{{book.project.name}} server for the first time.  If you just want to test drive {{book.project.name}}, it pretty much runs out of the box with its
own embedded and local-only database.  For
 actual deployments that are going to be run in production you'll need to decide how you want to manage server configuration
 at runtime (standalone or domain mode), configure a shared database for {{book.project.name}} storage, set up encryption and HTTPS,
 and finally set up {{book.project.name}} to run in a cluster.  This guide walks through each and every aspect of any pre-boot
 decisions and setup you must do prior to deploying the server.

One thing to particularly note is that {{book.project.name}} is derived from the {{book.appserver.name}} Application Server.
Many aspects of configuring a {{book.project.name}} revolve around {{book.appserver.name}} configuration elements.  Often
this guide will direct you to documentation outside of the manual if you want to dive into more detail.
