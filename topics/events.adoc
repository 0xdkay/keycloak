= Creating Event LIsteners

Keycloak provides an Events SPI that makes it possible to register listeners for user related events, for example user logins.
There are two interfaces that can be implemented, the first is a pure listener, the second is a events store which listens for events, but is also required to store events.
An events store provides a way for the admin and account management consoles to view events.
