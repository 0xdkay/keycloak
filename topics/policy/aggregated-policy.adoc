== Aggregated Policies

As mentioned before, Keycloak allows you to build a policy of policies, a concept that we call *Aggregated Policies*. Policy aggregation allows you to reuse existing policies to build more complex ones and keep your permissions even more decoupled from the
policies that are actually evaluated during the processing of authorization requests.

To create a new policy select the option *Aggregated* in the dropdown located in the right upper corner of the permission listing.

Let's suppose you have a resource called _Confidential Resource_ that can be accessed only by users from the _keycloak.org_ domain and within a IP address.
You may want to create a single policy with both conditions. However, you may want to reuse the domain part of this policy to apply to permissions despite the network.

In this case, Keycloak allows you to create separated policies for both domain and network conditions and create another one based on
them. You can easily achieve that by using an *Aggregated Policy* that combines other policies and then apply this aggregated policy to any permission you want.

[NOTE]
When creating aggregated policies, make sure you don't introduce a circular reference/dependency between policies. If you do so, Keycloak will not let you create or update the policy.

=== Configuration

* *Name*
+
A human-readable and unique string describing the policy. We strongly suggest you to use names that are closely related with your business and security requirements, so you
can identify them more easily and also know what they actually mean
+
* *Description*
+
A string with more details about this policy
+
* *Apply Policy*
+
Defines a set of one or more policies to associate with a policy
+
* *Decision Strategy*
+
The decision strategy for this permission
+
* *Logic*
+
The link:logic.html[logic] of this policy

=== Decision Strategy for Aggregated Policies

When creating aggregated policies, you can also define the decision strategy that will be used during to calculate the final decision based on the outcome from each policy.

* *Unanimous*
+
This is the default strategy if none is provided. In this case, _all_ policies must evaluate to a positive decision in order to the final decision be also positive.
+
* *Affirmative*
+
In this case, _at least one_ policy must evaluate to a positive decision in order to the final decision be also positive.
+
* *Consensus*
+
In this case, the number of positive decisions must be greater than the number of negative decisions. If the number of positive and negative decisions is the same, the final decision will be negative.
