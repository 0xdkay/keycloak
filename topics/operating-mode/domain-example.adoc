== Domain Mode Example Walkthrough

As noted in the <<domain.adoc#,domain mode>> chapter, {{book.project.name}} comes with a mostly pre-configured clustered domain
setup.  This chapter walks you through this out of the box configuration highlighting each aspect of each configuration
file you need to touch and manage.  At the end, the chapter discusses what changes you'll need to make to this out of the
box configuration to have it work in a real cluster.
