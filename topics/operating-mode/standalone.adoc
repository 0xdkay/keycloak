=== Standalone Mode

Standalone operating mode is only useful when you want to run one, and only one {{book.project.name}} server instance.  Standalone
instances contain all the configuration files they need locally.  What this basically means is that any configuration done
must be done on the config files contained in the installed distribution on the machine the {{book.project.name}} is going to run on
{{book.project.name}} standalone mode is available pre-configured out of the box.  It turns off clustering entirely
and turns any distributed caches into local-only ones.

==== Standalone Boot Script

When running the server in standalone mode, there is a specific script you need to run to boot the server depending on your
operating system.  These scripts live in the _bin/_ directory of the server distribution.

To boot the server:

[source]

$ .../bin/standalone.sh
----

.Windows
[source]
----
> ...\bin\standalone.bat

==== Standalone Configuration

The bulk of this guide walks you through how to configure infrastructure level aspects of {{book.project.name}}.  These
aspects are configured in a configuration file that is specific to the application server that {{book.project.name}} is a
derivative of.  In the standalone operation mode, this file lives in _.../standalone/configuration/standalone.xml_.

NOTE: Any changes you make to this file while the server is running will not take effect and may even be overwritten
      by the server.  Instead use the the command line scripting or the web console of {{book.appserver.name}}.  See
      the link:{{book.appserver.admindoc.link}}[{{book.appserver.admindoc.name}}] for more information.


==== Standalone {{book.project.name}} Configuration

{{book.project.name}} has a json configuration file that is specific to {{book.project.name}} this is located within
_.../standalone/configuration/keycloak.json_.  This file is used to configure non-infrastructure level things that are
only applicable to {{book.project.name}}

NOTE: Any changes you make to this file while the server is running will not take effect.  You'll need to reboot the
      server.
