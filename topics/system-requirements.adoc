= System Requirements

These are the requirements to run the {{book.project.name}} authentication server:

* Java 8 JDK
* Network multicast support if you clustering {{book.project.name}}.

{{book.project.name}} can be clustered without multicast, but this requires a bunch of configuration changes.  Please see
the <<_clustering,clustering>> section of this guide for more information.
