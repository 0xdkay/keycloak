After creating the user, log out of the management console by clicking the right dropdown menu and selecting *Sign Off*.
Next, log in to the User Account Service of your `demo` realm with the user you just created by clicking this link:

User Account Link::
  http://localhost:8080/auth/realms/demo/account

Enter the username and temporary password you created.  You must create a permanent password after you
successfully log in.

Finally, you will be brought to the User Account Service.  Every user in a realm has access to this Account Service by default.
It allows you to update profile information and change or add additional credentials. For more information on this service see the link:{{book.project.doc_base_url}}{{book.project.doc_info_version_url}}{{book.adminguide.link}}[{{book.adminguide.name}}].
