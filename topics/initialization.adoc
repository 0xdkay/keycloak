== Server Initialization

After performing all the installation and configuration tasks defined in the link:{{book.installguide.link}}[{{book.installguide.name}}],
you will need to create an initial admin account.
{{book.project.name}} does not have any configured admin account out of the box.
This account will allow you to create an admin that can log into the _master_ realm's administration console so that
you can start creating realms, users and registering applications to be secured by {{book.project.name}}.

If your
server is accessible from `localhost`, you can boot it up and create this admin user by going to the http://localhost:8080/auth URL.

Simply specify the username and password you want for this initial admin.

If you cannot access the server via a `localhost` address, or just want to provision {{book.project.name}} form the command line
you can do this with the `add-user-keycloak` script.
