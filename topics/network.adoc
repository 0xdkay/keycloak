== Network Setup

{{book.project.name}} can run out of the box, with some limitations.  For one, all network endpoints bind to +localhost+
so the auth server is really only usable on one local machine.  For HTTP based connections, it does not use default ports
like 80 and 443.  The SSO protocols that {{book.project.name}} uses all require
SSL/HTTPS or otherwise these protocols have some serious vulnerabilities.  HTTPS/SSL is not configured out of the box.
Finally, {{book.project.name}}
may often need to make secure SSL connections to external servers and thus need a trust store set up so that endpoints can
be validated correctly.  This chapter discusses all of these things.
